**What I learned through the projects:**

**Day 1 - Tamer's Handy-Dandy Band Name Generator**
I created a brand name generator app that asks questions and concatenates the responses to create an awesome band name!
**skills learned: string manipulation, input function, variables, print function**

**Day 2 - Makin' It Rain Tip Calculator**
I created a tip calculator app that takes input of total bill, tip amount, and number of people to split with, then outputs a calculation of the total each person should pay.
**skills learned: data types, numbers, operations, type conversion, f-strings**

**Day 3 - Choose Wisely Adventure Game**
I created an adventure game utilizing if/else and elif conditional statements to determine the path one takes to test your luck at finding the treasure and winning the game!
**skills learned: conditional statements, logical operators, code blocks, scope**

**Day 4 - Rock, Paper, Scissor Game**
This is one of my favorite childhood game and took a lot of fun mental gymnastics to code!
I used a python list to add my answer choices to. I used the random module for the computer to create a unique experience each iteration and finally elif statements to compare to user input choice to figure who won the game.
**skills learned: randomisation, python lists**

**Day 5 - PyPassword Generator**
This password generator takes input from a user how many letters, numbers and symbols they would like for their password to have. There is an easy version where it adds in order and a hard version that randomizes the character order of the password.
**skills learned: for loops, range, code blocks**

**Day 6 - Reeborg's World Escape the Maze Challenge**
In this challenge, I put loop, function, and conditional statement skills together for Reeborg to successfully navigate the maze to the finish line!

**skills learned: functions, code blocks, while loops**

**Day 7 - Hangman Game!**
I created a hangman game putting all the concepts I learned so far. This has testes my knowledge of loops and conditional statements to make the ultimate user experience. This project calls two modules that I grouped into a Day7 hangman modules folder for viewing.
**skills: for and while loops, if/else, lists, strings, range, modules**
