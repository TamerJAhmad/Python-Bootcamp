What I learned through the projects:

**Day 1 - Tamer's Handy-Dandy Band Name Generator**
I created a brand name generator app that asks questions and concatenates the responses to create an awesome band name!
**skills learned: string manipulation, input function, variables, print function**

**Day 2 - Makin' It Rain Tip Calculator**
I created a tip calculator app that takes input of total bill, tip amount, and number of people to split with, then outputs a calculation of the total each person should pay.
**skills learned: data types, numbers, operations, type conversion, f-strings**

**Day 3 - Choose Wisely Adventure Game**
I created an adventure game utilizing if/else and elif conditional statements to determine the path one takes to test your luck at finding the treasure and winning the game!
**skills learned: conditional statements, logical operators, code blocks, scope**

**Day 4 - Rock, Paper, Scissor Game**
This is one of my favorite childhood game and took a lot of fun mental gymnastics to code!
I used a python list to add my answer choices to. I used the random module for the computer to create a unique experience each iteration and finally elif statements to compare to user input choice to figure who won the game.
**skills learned: randomisation, python lists**
